Hello, here is Yonghang Tang. It is my second years studying in BSU, and my major is computer science.

In this semester, I hope that I can learn more information about computer science, also I hope that I can learn more programing language in this semester. 

The interestiing thing about me, I once ate four McDonald's burgers.
